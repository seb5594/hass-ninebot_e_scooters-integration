# Protocol sources

Primary documentation: [ScooterHacking Wiki](https://wiki.scooterhacking.org/doku.php?id=nbdocs)
and [Ninebot ES Scooter Protocol PDF](https://wiki.scooterhacking.org/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=ninebot_es_scooter_protocol_918.pdf).
PDF sections 2.1–2.7 describe frames, addresses, commands and checksums; sections
4–5 describe ES and BMS registers. The ES table must not be assumed valid for
every Xiaomi or newer Ninebot model.

Upstream documents ES BLE109/110, Max BLE110/113/114, E BLE209/213 and F BLE307.
Some Xiaomi BLE132 dashboards use 5A AB and remain disabled here. The ninebot-ble
author reports access to an F-series scooter and uses PC address 0x3D. That is
protocol evidence, not a hardware test of this integration.

## Issues corrected in the supplied implementation

- Discovery accepted unrelated devices advertising the shared Nordic UART service.
- Crypto key transitions were fixed to phone address 0x3E, preventing PC-host reuse.
- The legacy link promised serialized reads but had no lock; concurrent callers
  could discard each other's replies.
- Some Xiaomi blocks decoded without checking source or read opcode.
- Repeated failed sessions retained short fixed retry intervals.
- Reconfiguration retained another physical scooter's pairing state.
- Saved keys were decoded without validating the required 16-byte length.
- Authenticated receive queues had no memory bound.

The original MAC/checksum validation, stored-key probes, late pairing ACK retention,
fresh-device policy and disabled scanner failover are retained.
